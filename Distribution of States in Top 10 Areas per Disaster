#Distribution of States in Top 10 Areas per Disaster
#I created a bar chart to visualize the distribution of states in the top 10 areas per disaster. 
#The height of each bar represents the count (frequency) of states that appear in the top 10 areas for different types of disasters. 
#This gives an indication of how often each state is mentioned as a high-risk area across various disaster categories. 
#Different colors represent different types of disasters (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes). 
#By examining the distribution of states across these colors, you can observe which states are frequently mentioned as high-risk areas for specific types of disasters
